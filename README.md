# KmpDestop
Android App with Desktop exe


## Overview
KmpDestop is a Kotlin Multiplatform project designed to demonstrate the ability to develop both an Android application and a Windows desktop executable using a single codebase. This project showcases my proficiency in Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and my understanding of cross-platform development.

## Features
- Single codebase for both Android and Windows applications
- Uses Jetpack Compose for UI development
- Utilizes Kotlin Multiplatform for cross-platform logic
- Platform-specific implementations where necessary

## Technologies Used
- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Enables code sharing across Android and Windows
- **Jetpack Compose**: Declarative UI framework for building modern UIs
- **Gradle**: Build automation system for managing dependencies and configurations
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Handles asynchronous programming efficiently
